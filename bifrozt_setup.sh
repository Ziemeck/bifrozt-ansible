#   --------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   - 0.0.3-DEV
#     * Added change log data
#     * Removing the neccesity of using 'sudo su -' by generating the Ansible SSH key in a
#       custom location and setting the 'private_key_file' in ansible.cfg.
#     * Added 'info' argument.
#     * Supressed output from various commands.
#
#   - 0.0.4-DEV
#     * ´info´ argument has been removed.
#     * Dedicated function will now generate time stamps. 
#     * Replaced hardcoded items that were used multiple times with
#       declared variables
#     * Consolidated all scripted apt-get actions into a single function.
#     * Git clone function made re-usable.
#     * Function for getting IPv4 address from interfaces made re-usable.
#     * Random DHCP network generation during setup.
#     * Random IPv4 address for the honeypot generated during setup.
#     * Chooses a random empheral port for SSH administration.
#     * Updates firewall rules with new SSH port.
#     * Script now requires the MAC address of the honeypot as an argument.
#
#   - 0.0.5
#     * Makes HonSSH configuration active.
#
#   - 0.0.6
#     * Added tests to prevent script from failing due to missing files and
#       directories.
#     * Script will begin and end with a clean up function that will purge
#       obsolete software and Git repos from the system.
#     * The script will delete itself when all functions have been executed.
